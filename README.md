# Random Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password based on user input. It combines uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols to create a strong and secure password.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generator.git
   cd password-generator
   ```

2. Run the `generate_password.py` script:

   ```bash
   python generate_password.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts:

   - Enter your **name** (case-insensitive).
   - Enter your **age** (numeric value).

4. The script will create a password with the following characteristics:

   - Starts with a random digit.
   - Includes an uppercase letter from your name.
   - Includes a lowercase letter from your name.
   - Includes a random symbol.
   - Ends with a digit from your age.

5. The generated password will be displayed on the console.

## Example

```
Enter Your Name:
John
Enter Your Age:
30

Your newly generated password is: J0hN#25
```

Feel free to modify the code or adjust the password length according to your requirements.
